TO make changes to the file uploaded in s3 bucket, we need to add role to the ec2 instance to access s3.

 UserData:
        Fn::Base64: !Sub |
          #!/bin/bash -xe
          yum update -y
          amazon-linux-extras install -y nginx1
          rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*
          aws s3 cp s3://${WebServerBucket}/index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/
          service nginx start

Role cannot be attached directly to instance, so we need a Instance profile. Instance profile is referenced from ec2 instance.


* Creating IAM roles in templates requires some acknowledgments. So to do this we add capabilities in deploy scripts. If we are deploying through console
there are checkboxes for capabilities.

--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
or 
--capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM   -- if its a custom role.
