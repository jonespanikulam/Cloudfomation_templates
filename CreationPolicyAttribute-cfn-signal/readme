SAME files used for use-iam templates are used here. Only creationpolicy and cfn signal are added.

To make the webserver instance wait util the user data script finish sucessfully and make it reach CREATE_COMPLETE state only if the script succeed we use
CreationPolicy attribute and cfn-signal script.

CreationPolicy attribute:
* Prevent the resource reaching CREATE_COMPLETE state until a specified number of sucess signals are received. If this fails it rolls back
* currently supported in ec2 instance and autoscaling group.
* cfn signal used from inside aws, if needed to be sent from outside use cloudfomation signal resource api 

CreationPolicy:
      ResourceSignal:
        Count: 1
        Timeout: PT10M    ----wait 10 minutes to finsh the script.


Cfn-signal used to update the cloudformation resource to indicate whether it is updated sucessfully or not.

/opt/aws/bin/cfn-signal -s true --stack ${AWS::StackName} --resource WebServerInstance --region ${AWS::Region}

From events tab in cloudformation you can see only after the success signal sent from cfn-signal, the event CREATE_COMPLETE is published.
