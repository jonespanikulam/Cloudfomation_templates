Cross stack 

            export      OUTPUTS   import   
VPC stack   ------>    (SUBNETS) ------->  DATABASE STACK  


- outputs of vpc stack for subnet and security group can be imported to database stack.


You cannnot change the value of the exported output, if it already imported by another stack. You should take this into account while deciding which output to export
stack. In cross stack references you share the resources between stacks. Here each stack is managed seperately so your update may have unexpected consequences
on the stack which is importing it. So to avoid this you can use nested stacks.

Referenced stack(database stack) should be deleted first before deleateing the vpc stack. You can prevent accidental deletion of exported stack by turning on
termination protection.
